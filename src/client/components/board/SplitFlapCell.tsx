/**
 * One position of the board, with the cards of its drum.
 *
 * A flap of Solari is a card with two halves. The board holds one card for each
 * character of the drum, and the cards fall one after the other until the
 * correct character arrives. Therefore this component gives one element for
 * each half of each card:
 *
 * - The two halves at rest are under the cards. The top half holds the final
 *   character, and the cards above it go away one after the other. The bottom
 *   half holds the first character of the turn, and the cards cover it.
 * - Each card gives a top half with the character that goes away, and a bottom
 *   half with the character that arrives.
 *
 * `zIndex` makes the order of the cards. A card that falls early is above the
 * cards after it, thus each card shows the card below it. A bottom half that
 * arrives late is above the halves before it, thus the last half stays.
 *
 * `--flap-index` gives the place of the flap on the board, and `--flap-step`
 * gives the place of the card in the drum. The file `styles/theme.css` makes
 * the delay with those two values. The logic of the drum is in `lib/flaps.ts`.
